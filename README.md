<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Elizabeth Calaio</h1>
<h3 align="center">Pricing | Business Intelligence | Analytics</h3>

- ðŸ”­ **Iâ€™m a Pricing & BI Specialist.**
I have experience using Power BI, Microstrategy, excel, Sas and SQL for data extraction, wrangling, cleaning, transformation, modeling, analysis and visualization. I specifically use Power BI for building reports and dashboards that communicates insights in a more structured way. You can check out some of my Power BI projects. I have solid experience in the development of Pricing and BI areas acquired in different companies from different industries. This allowed me to acquire leadership and execution skills to be able to implement all the knowledge that we acquire with data analysis and that the team incorporates it as a tool for decision making. As well as being able to follow up on a strategy and be able to evaluate more objectively the impact of each of the variables on the results.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently pursuing **a degree in data science to deepen my knowledge of machine learning of real cases with Rstudio.**
